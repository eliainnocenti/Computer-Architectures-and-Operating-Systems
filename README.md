# Computer Architectures and Operating Systems

![polito](resources/logo_polito.jpg)

This repository contains all the materials and exercises for the **Computer Architectures and Operating Systems** course. The repository utilizes a script to keep all submodules up to date.
<!-- and provides a structured way to work on personal modifications within a separate branch. -->

## ⚠️ Important Notice

> **Note:** This repository is for educational purposes only. Make sure to follow the course rules and guidelines when utilizing these materials.

> **Note:** The current implementation is not fully up to date. Modifications will follow to address all outstanding issues.

<!-- > **Note:** The pulling and data collection from all submodules works, but managing the personal branch for developing personal modifications is still not functioning. -->

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection point for all the labs and exercises related to the course. It is designed to automatically clone or pull updates from the official teaching repositories and to provide a clear workflow for adding personal modifications to the exercises.

By using a script to manage submodules, the repository ensures that all dependencies and repositories are always up-to-date. 
<!-- The repository also supports working on a separate branch called `personal` to track personal modifications without affecting the main repository. -->

## Structure

- `Laboratories/`: Contains all laboratory repositories.
- `Exercises/`: Contains all exercise repositories.
- `urls.txt`: A file containing all repository URLs and their custom names.
- `manage_submodules.sh`: A script used to automatically clone and update all submodules (laboratories and exercises).

## Current Repositories

Below is the current list of repositories managed by the script:

| Type     | Repository URL                                                                                                  | Custom Name         |

## Usage

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository along with all the submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/neo-CAOS/Teaching-material.git
cd Teaching-material
```

### Running the Update Script

The script `manage_submodules.sh` automates the process of updating all the submodules (labs and exercises). It reads repository URLs from the `urls.txt` file, clones them (if not already cloned), or pulls updates from the remote repositories.

To run the script:

```bash
./manage_submodules.sh
```

The script will:

1. Clone any missing repositories into the `Laboratories/` and `Exercises/` directories.
2. Pull updates for existing repositories.

### FreeRTOS config [ To be done! ]

<!-- TODO -->

### Creating a Personal Branch [ Not working! ]

To work on the exercises and make your own modifications without affecting the main repository, follow these steps to create a new `personal` branch:

1. Switch to the `main` branch (if you're not already on it):

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Create and switch to a new branch called `personal`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b personal
   ```

3. Make your changes and commit them:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "My modifications to the exercises"
   ```

4. Push your personal `branch` to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin personal
   ```

Once the branch is pushed, you will be able to switch between the `main` and `personal` branches in GitHub and view your modifications by selecting the corresponding branch.
